
# BIO609. PartI: Introduction to Linux
------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the first part of our introductory course on Linux! 

### Why learning the command line?

If you are in this course, you are probably interested in starting to do some bioinformatics, but you might also be curious! 

In either case, if you want to start doing bioinformatics, it is particularly important to learn the command-line, because most of the bioinformatics software is controlled by using it. And if you later, would like to develop tools to work with data, it is also a pre-requisite to know how to work around a terminal.

Let's get started, but first things first, **open the terminal** or command-line interpreter by:

- Pressing **Ctrl+Alt+T**, which is the easiest way.
- Clicking on **Terminal** in the pinned *default* programs bar.
- Going to programs in the **menu** and clicking on **Terminal**.
- Writing **Terminal** in the search bar.

## The command-line

A command is a directive to the [command-line interpreter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI) or [Shell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)), and is a means of interacting with a program in the form of sucessive lines of text (command lines).

Most command names are abbreviations of their functions, that help us remember what they do.

## Classic commands


| Command | Meaning |
| ------ | ------ |
| ls |	List files/directories
|ls -a |	List all files/directories (including hidden)
|cd directory |	Change to directory
|cd	| Change to home directory  (with nothing next to cd)
|cd ~ |	Change to home directory
|cd ~/Documents |	Change to a subfolder of your home directory (in this case Documents)
|cd .. |	Exit directory 
|mkdir | Make a directory
|cp	| Copy a file/directory
|rm | Delete a file/directory

### Let's try a few commands in the terminal:

NOTE: If you haven't opened the terminal, open one by using **Ctrl+Alt+T**

```sh
#Go to your home directory
cd ~    
#make a directory
mkdir Linux01
#go to directory
cd Linux01
# exit directory
cd ..
```
